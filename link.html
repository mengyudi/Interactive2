<h1>Henri Cartier-Bresson The Modern Century</h1>

<span id="directionality">â–¼</span>
<p>An innovative artist, trailblazing photojournalist, and quintessential world traveler, Henri Cartier-Bresson ranks among the most accomplished and original figures in the history of photography. His inventive images of the early 1930s helped define the creative potential of the medium, and his uncanny ability to capture life on the run made his work synonymous with "the decisive moment." This major retrospective offers a fresh look at Cartier-Bresson's entire career, revealing him as one of the great portraitists of the 20th century and one of its keenest observers of the global theater of human affairs.

<p>This exhibition is organized by The Museum of Modern Art, New York. The San Francisco presentation is made possible by major support from The Bernard Osher Foundation. Generous support is provided by the Bernard and Barbro Osher Exhibition Fund.</p>
